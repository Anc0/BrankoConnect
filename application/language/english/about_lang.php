<p class='font-bold font-size-18'>Most people would consider my life the best a person can have. I had several dream jobs, many great 
contacts, travelling, but in reality there was always something missing, until …</p>

$lang['about_content'] = "
<p class='font-size-14'>I live in Ljubljana, the most beautiful city in the world, and Slovenia is really a wonderful land. 
I enjoy the privilege of being able to ski in the mountains in the morning, and have a drink with my 
friends at the seaside in the afternoon. The land is ideal for driving a motorcycle, which I love. I 
have two wonderful children who participate with me in business ventures and we have great joy.</p>

<p class='font-size-14'>However, the things were not always perfect and let’s go step by step. </p>

<p class='font-size-14'>As a child I dreamed of only two things, about cars and having my own business. Questioning about 
the school selection, I knew the answer »The one, where I would learn all about cars.« My first wish 
came true with studies of Mechanical Engineering in High school and at the University. It was really 
fascinating for me. Then I got employment at the Faculty, and it started to change.</p>

<p class='font-size-14'>In the elementary school I noticed that people were following me, they liked to listen to my words 
and believed what I said. In my entire professional career I was holding the top management positions,
 a CEO and a General Manager. In short, people saw how successful I was. But I knew that I could be 
 much more successful and satisfied as an entrepreneur.</p>

<p class='font-size-14'>Several years had to pass that my childhood desire was fulfilled. I passed the border (finally!!!) 
and kicked myself from the comfort zone of the business world in the world of freedom for which 
I craved.</p>

<p class='font-size-14'>Probably it is not a coincidence that ten years ago I started flirting with network marketing, 
where I saw the opportunity to work with people to help them, teach them and achieve financial and 
personal freedom. But the beginnings were not easy. My mentality of the employee in the comfort zone 
repeatedly ruined access to the success. But gradually I eradicated these habits.</p>

<p class='font-size-14'>However, I'm not a typical salesperson; I led sales and/or marketing throughout my career. In doing 
so, I was very successful.... but. When I faced network marketing, I have always been bothered that 
with a feeling that someone was pushing me to do something. I was used to sell in a way that people 
were able to experience the products or services, and thus I was unwittingly carrying out Attraction 
Marketing in practice.</p>

<p class='font-size-14'>Therefore, the discovery of EMP Attraction Marketing Formula was a revelation for me and at that 
moment I knew that this was it. I signed up at Boot camp and got solutions for the problems which I 
have struggled with for many years. For me, it was a complete turnaround for the better. Working in 
the network marketing opened a new dimension for me, and I enjoy it very much.</p>

<p class='font-size-14'>People want to buy from me, because I do not push them to buy. I help them, educate them and assist 
them in making their lives better. Now I don’t do business with people who complain and lack positive 
energy, but with those who are open-minded, benevolent and inspired by positive things. People keep 
contacting me to help them in their endeavors to reach their freedom in life.</p> 

<p class='font-size-14'>I achieved financial and personal freedom, and now I can dedicate to my second passion - cars. I 
also missed more time for my family and friends that have been perfectly solved now and we enjoy great 
time together. </p>
